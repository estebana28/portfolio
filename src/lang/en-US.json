In a middle of difficult moment (COVID-19) this company bet on me and made me an offer impossible to refuse. From start to finish the process was more than satisfactory. Here we work in team, with the latest technologies in more than challenging projects and I love it",

Some may say that this experience is irrelevant, maybe they are right, but I want to explain why it is relevant to me. In this extensive work experience, I formed my professional and personal character. I learned a lot in several aspects, like teamwork, that individualities do not exist, there are too many sectors and co-partners involved and without continuous cooperation it would be almost impossible to carry out patient care. I do not want to leave aside, multidisciplinary work, where working together with other professionals, such as (nurses, doctors, maintenance workers, maids, cook, and many others), is a daily thing. Conflict resolution, coordinated decision making , and their implementation, and so on, are daily tasks in a large and highly complex hospital."
